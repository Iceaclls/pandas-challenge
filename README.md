Analysis Summary
-After looking at the type of school and scores, it is evident that the charter types have a much greater passing rate in both reading and math then the district schools. We can also see that the top 5 schools in overall passing rate are charter schools.

Conclusions
-If we look at the Math Scores by grade and compare them to reading scores by grade, we see that reading scores are constantly higher then math
-By looking at the school spending and comparing it to math and reading scores, we can see that their is little to no correlation between the two variables
